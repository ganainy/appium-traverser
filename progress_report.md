# Progress Report

## Implemented Features

### Static Analysis with MobSF
The project integrates MobSF for static analysis of Android applications. This allows for the identification of security vulnerabilities and code quality issues. The implementation can be found in `traverser_ai_api/mobsf_manager.py`.

### Network Packet Capture with PCAPDroid
Network traffic analysis is implemented using PCAPDroid. This enables the capture and inspection of network packets to and from the device, which is crucial for understanding the app's behavior and identifying potential data leaks. The implementation can be found in `traverser_ai_api/traffic_capture_manager.py`.
